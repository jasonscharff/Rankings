Rankings
========

An algorithm where given a text file with team names and scores ranks the teams in order. This handles the cases for a pure order, a subjective order (two teams are ranked equally so the program decides), and a cyclic graph or two or more unmatched sets. While the program should be working currently (please report any known bugs), it is not fully documented (coming soon!)
