Rankings
========

An algorithm where given a text file with team names and scores ranks the teams in order. This handles the cases for a pure order, a subjective order (two teams are ranked equally so the program decides), and a cyclic graph or two unmatched sets. This program is currently in development and the cyclic and unmatched set cases have not yet been built and the rest of the program is not yet documented or fully tested.
